Hey, I'm Lassi, a Finnish software/game developer.

This is my project website for displaying my works and maybe in the future doing blog or technical posts of neat stuff I am working on.
I enjoy getting to work with data and learning to understand the inner workings of systems.

I love Japanese media especially visual novels, some of my favorites are [Hoshizora no Memoria](https://vndb.org/v1474){:target="_blank"}, [Senren * Banka](https://vndb.org/v19073){:target="_blank"} and [Little Busters!](https://vndb.org/v5){:target="_blank"}.

Don't copy, learn.
