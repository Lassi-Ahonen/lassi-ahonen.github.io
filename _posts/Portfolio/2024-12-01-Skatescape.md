## Project

Skatescape is a rythm game inspired by Vib-Ribbon where you need to dodge obstacles by performing actions and combos.

Most of my time for this project went into programming tools for my team to create beatmaps and play frame based animations. I also programmed the logic for the player and obstacles.

### Key features

- Stage based gameplay with highscores and combo counters
- Obstacles synchronized to music
- Player combo actions
