## Project

Texture channel packer is a tool for creating packed textures. It can take four input textures for each Red, Green, Blue and Alpha channels of the output and fill those color channels from the input textures and color channels.

### Key features

- Color channel copying from input textures to output
- Ability to invert the input channels
- Automatic or manual output texture size
- Output preview with toggles to see specific color channels and transparency

## Repository

The tool is released as free Unity package on my GitHub.
