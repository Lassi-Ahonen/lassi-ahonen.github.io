## Project

Story game that was released on android about a business lady waking up in the middle of a forest. She encounters Tapio, master of the forest and she gets tasked with arranging a banquet. But what awaits after the banquet?

For this project I worked on multiple different roles and helped other teammates to get started with making games.

My biggest achievement for this project was the dialogue system and a graph based tool to make dialogue for it.

### Key features

- Branching dialogue
- No enforced playing route
- Multiple minigames featuring different animal characters

### Trailer video
